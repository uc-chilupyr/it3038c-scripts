# Project 1

### Instructions to run this program 

This program counts the occurance of a desired character in a user entered phrase or word.

To run this program, make sure that Python3 is installed and working. You can validate this by running in your command prompt on Windows or Linux:

If using Windows, type:
```powershell
python --version
```

If using Linux, you may need to specify Python3
```bash
python3 --version
```

Now, from the Project1 folder that contains main.py, run the program using Python

```bash
python3 main.py
```

Example Output: 
```bash
$ python3 main.py
Enter the string/phrase to count the characters: *Hello*
Enter the character you want counted: *h*
The number of times '**h' occurs in 'Hello' is 
1
```
### Error Handling

The program is intended to count single character occurences, so the program would reject multiple characters and prompt you to type a single character.
```bash
Please enter only 1 character!!
Please enter again:
```
