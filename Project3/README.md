# Project 3

### Instructions to run this program 

This program takes the input of from the User and coverts the entered currency into a desired currency.

To run this program, make sure that Python3 is installed and working. You can validate this by running in your command prompt on Windows or Linux:

If using Windows, type:
```powershell
python --version
```

If using Linux, you may need to specify Python3
```bash
python3 --version
```

Now, from the Project1 folder that contains main.py, run the program using Python

```bash
python3 main.py
```

Before running it is important to install the requried module for the API requests and for BeautifulSoup which I used for the data.

So to install type the following 
```bash
python -m pip install bs4 requests 
```

If python isn't install on your windows system you can type
```bash
D:\ python
```
to install it from mircrosoft store

if you are using pycharm or any other IDE to test you can directly install it on the IDE

Example Output: 
```bash
$ python3 main.py
What would you like to do? (Enter help to look at the coversion codes or Enter convert to using the conversion scale): 
Enter the currency to be converted from:: USD
Enter the currency to be converted to:: EUR
How much: 200
200 USD = 166.15 EUR

Process finished with exit code 0
```

There is a help table with the country codes and their names in the code. Just type 'HELP' to see it.
Here is an example of that output.
```bash
$ python3 main.py

```bash
